====================
Draco Error Handling
====================

Introduction
============

This document describes how errors are handled within Draco.


Exceptions
==========

The folowing exception hierarchy is defined::

  DracoException +- DracoError +- ModelError
                 |             |- DatabaseError
                 |             `- ...
                 `- ServerReturn +- HttpOk
                                 |- HttpNotFound
                                 `- ...

The two main types of exceptions are ``DracoError'' subclasses and
``ServerReturn'' subclasses. DracoError subclasses are raised by Draco
subcomponents and indicate an error in the subcomponent. These errors should
be captured by the calling code, which can be Draco internal code or end
user code. A DracoError exception that is not caught will result in a HTTP
internal server error 500 response.

The ``ServerReturn'' subclasses are never raised by Draco itself and are
used exclusively by end-user code. The reason for this is that the Draco
subcomponents are written to be independent components that can be tested
separately and can be used outside the Draco framework as well. Each
ServerReturn subclass has an associated HTTP status code, and optionally
headers and a request body. ServerReturn exception are caught by the
top-level Draco handler and result is a HTTP response as defined by the
exception.


HTTP Related Errors in Draco
============================

As explained above, Draco itself never raises a ServerReturn exception. If a
Draco subcomponent is involved in the HTTP request processing and wants to
be able to return specific HTTP status codes, the convention is that the
function returns a 2-tuple as the return value. The first entry of the tuple
is the HTTP status code (HTTP_OK for no error) and the second entry is the
return data (None in case of error).


Handler Return Values
=====================

Draco handlers can indicate an error in two ways.

1. By raising a ServerReturn exception.
2. By returning a HTTP response code other than HTTP_OK (200). Definitions
   of all HTTP response codes can be found in ``draco.util.http''.
