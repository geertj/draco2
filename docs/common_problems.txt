Common Problems when building Dynamic Websites
==============================================

In other words, what Draco should resolve in order to be an efficient
framework for creating dynamic web sites.


1. Date Formatting
------------------

It is very common to require to format a date. In fact, every date should
be formatted before it can be presented to the user. Clearly, a date
should be formatted in the current locale. But what about different
formats within a locale. In my experience, some of the formats that are
requires are: compact, regular, full. In US/English conventions, these
would correspond to: *mm/dd/yy hh:mm*, *mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm:ss* and *dayname
dd monthname yyyy, hh:mm:sss.

How and where to build this functionality?

Current insight: add custom strftime() formatting operators?
