====================
Draco Code Structure
====================

The Draco code base is divided into the following sub-directories::

    /iface
    /core
    /util
    /draco
    /xmlrpc


interface
---------

The ``iface`` directory contains the Draco abstract webserver interface
``HTTPInterface``, and various subclasses implementing the interface for
various web server platforms.

core
----

The ``core`` directory contains the Draco request dispatcher, and core Draco
objects that are independent of the handler type.

util
----

The ``util`` directory contains self-contained utility modules that could be
used outside the context of Draco as well.

draco
-----

Contains the Draco handler. The Draco handler is the principal programming
interface for creating web applications.

xmlrpc
------

Contains the XML-RPC handler.


documentation
-------------

The ``documentation`` directory contains reST formatted source code
documentation.
