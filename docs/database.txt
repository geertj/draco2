Draco Database API
==================

Introduction
============

The Draco database API is as a front-end to a few DB-API modules of
different database backends. It has two primary users:

1. Draco itself. All database access in Draco goes through the Draco
   database API.
2. End user code. End users are encouraged to use the Draco database API.


The follwing features are provides by the database API:

1. Automatic connection handling.
2. Common DB-API typing. Different database adapters often return different
   types for BLOB or DATETIME columns. The DB-API in fact merely recommends
   but does not mandate specific Python types for specific columns. This has
   lead to a wild diversity in handling of for example BLOB and the various
   DATE/TIME columns. The Draco Database API defines specific types for
   these columns and installs type converters in the underlying DB-API
   modules to implement these.
3. Simple dialect handling. Small differences in the SQL supported by the
   different database systems are handled by the Database API. The user can
   use standard SQL, which will translated to a database specific version.

Using the Database API
======================

The API is defined in the module ``draco.database``. The main class is the
``DatabaseManager`` class. It provides the following API:

Configuration File
------------------

A DatabaseManager can be configured using a configuration file. This is
illustrated below::

    [draco.database]
    interface = 'interface_name'
    dsn = 'data_source_string'


Type Conversions
----------------

The following type convestions are defined. These conversions work both
ways. If you want to add a value to a database, you'll have provide the
Python type in the table below to the DB-API. When this attribute is
queried, the same Python type will be returned.

===============  =================
SQL Column Type  Python Type
---------------  -----------------
BLOB             buffer
DATE             datetime.date
TIME             datetime.time
TIMESTAMP        datetime.datetime
INTERVAL         datetime.interval

Supported Database APIs
=======================

At the moment, the folowing RDBMSes are supported.

* Postgresql_, using the psycopg2 module.
* MySQL_, using the MySQLdb module.
