Object Protocol

Introduction
============

The Draco2 API is implemented by a set of objects, each of which are
accessible through the global ``api`` object. Some of these objects are
singletons, some of these are instantiated per request. Objects may depend
on other objects to function correctly. This document described the method
by which Draco2 objects are created, their life-cycle and how they interact
with other objects.


Object Construction
===================

Objects can be constructed in two ways. The first way is by simply calling the
class constructor. This way of constructing objects is used in the test code
for example. By convention, an object constructor should ask for all required
data to be able to operate.
