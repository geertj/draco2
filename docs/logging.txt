Logging in Draco
================

Introduction
============

This document described how logging is performed in Draco.

Python logging Package
======================

The principal method of logging for Draco is by using the standard Python
``logging`` package. The root logger is configured by Draco to send output
to the file ``draco.log`` in the document root of the web applications.

The advantages of using the logging package are:

1. Familiarity. The logging package is a standard Python package. This means
   that many people are already familiar with its interfac.e
2. Code duplication is reduced.
3. Availability. The logging package provides an interface that is always
   available, also outside the Draco framework. This is a great advantage
   when writing unit tests. Unit tests do not need to provide an own logger
   implementation.

Reasons for Logging
===================

Many reasons exist for logging. Some of these reasons are:

1. Troubleshooting the application (debugging).
2. Notification of exceptional circumstances.
3. Keeping a record of events for auditing purposes.

Inside the Draco implementation, logging is mostly performed because of 2.
User code can of course use the logging interface for any reason.
