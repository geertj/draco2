Draco Web Server Integration Model
==================================

Introduction
============

Draco is designed to work with multiple web servers. This document provides
a small introduction on how the integration works.


Integration Model
=================

First of all, it needs to be pointed out that Draco works exclusively with
the HTTP protocol. Some web servers (such as Apache) offer different
protocols as well. Draco does not support this, and there are no plans of
supporting this in the future. HTTP is the de-facto transport protocol these
days, and is used by many important Internet applications such as (X)HTML,
XML-RPC, SOAP and RSS. Draco is a framework for creating dynamic web
applications, and at the moment it is not clear whether there are important
non-HTTP based applications in this area.

In the Draco-Webserver integration model, the web server has the following
responsibilities. If a web server does not provide these, the integration
layer has to provide them.

1. HTTP request/response handling. Draco expects to be able to retrieve
   parsed HTTP request data (headers, status code, URI, ...) via the
   interface as well as to be able to form a HTTP response.
2. Authentication. Any authentication mechanims other than the builttin
   form/cookie based authentication must be provided by the interface. Draco
   will be able to pick up the results for some authentication schemes but
   the process of requiring authentication for certain URLs, negotiating and
   performing the authentication must be done completely by the interface.
3. I/O. Draco expects read/write functions that read and write data to/form
   the client.


Integration Interface
=====================

To integrate Draco with a web server, a subclass of ``HTTPRequest`` (defined
in ``draco.iface'' has to be provided, with all missing methods implemented.
See the source file ``interface/interface.py'' for a description of the
interface.


Calling Into Draco
==================

To complete the integration, the web server must be configured to call the
function ``handle_request'' (from ``draco.core.dispatch'') with the HTTP
request subclass.
