====================
A Note about Cookies
====================

There appear to be three specifications for cookies.

1. The original specification by netspace.
2. A specification from RFC2109.
3. A specification from RFC2965.

It seems that the majority of all clients still uses the original Netscape
specification.  This cookie class therefore uses that specification. The
Netscape specification can be found at:
