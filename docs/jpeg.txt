A Quick note about JPEG
=======================

This is a short technical note about JPEG headers and how to extract the
image dimensions.

A JFIF header consists of blocks. A block begins with one or more '0xff'
bytes, followed by a non 0xff byte indicating the type of the block. This is
then followed by a two byte length for the block.  We are interested in
block of types in the range 0xc0..0xcf, the so called SOFn (Start Of Frame
n) blocks. From these we can extract the image dimensions.
